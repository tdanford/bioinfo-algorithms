/**
 * Geometric and graphics primitives for Voronoi diagrams, convex hulls, etc.
 *
 * This package started as a test implementation of the Voronoi diagram code and exercises in
 * "Computational Geometry in C."
 *
 * However, I've started expanding it into implementations of other algorithms (convex hulls, etc)
 * and I'm working to extend it to a full implementation of the random maps generation methods outlined
 * here: https://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/
